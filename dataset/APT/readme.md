## About the datasets used in the APT and FRP experiments
Since the CAIDA dataset (which provides normal flows) cannot be made public, we did not upload our simulated datasets. If anyone is interested in them, you can ask us through anonymous comments (or any other method that meets the double-blind anonymous review rules).

## How to run
./compile.sh
